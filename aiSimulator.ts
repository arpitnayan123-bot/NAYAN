*Matched via Indian Healthcare Symptom Database (300+ entries)*

Based on clinical data, headache is commonly associated with: **${diseases.toLowerCase()}**. Average duration: **~${duration} days**.

Looking at your metrics:
• Your water intake is currently ${metrics.waterIntake}ml out of ${metrics.waterTarget}ml. Dehydration is the #1 trigger. Try drinking 2 glasses of lukewarm water immediately.
• You slept ${metrics.sleepHours} hours last night. Rest is crucial.

**AI Care Recommendations:**
1. **Hydration First:** Sip water or an electrolyte-rich drink.
2. **Rest:** Dim the lights, close your eyes, and avoid screens for 20-30 minutes.
3. **Gentle Massage:** Massage your temples and neck with lavender or peppermint oil.
4. **Cold Compress:** Place a cool damp cloth on your forehead or the back of your neck.

💬 *Describe symptoms in any of 11 Indian languages — powered by Bhashini-IndicNER.*

📊 *For a full symptom analysis with severity, duration & regional insights, visit the Symptom Checker.*

*Disclaimer: This is wellness guidance, not a medical diagnosis. If you experience sudden severe "thunderclap" headache, vision changes, or fever with stiff neck, seek emergency care immediately.*`,

It sounds like you're feeling under the weather. A fever or cold is usually the body's natural response to fighting off viral or bacterial infections.

**August-Style Aarogya Protocol:**
1. **Monitor Temperature:** Keep a temperature log every 4 hours.
2. **Hydration Alert:** Ensure you surpass your daily water goal of ${metrics.waterTarget}ml today (aim for herbal teas, warm broths).
3. **Rest & Recovery:** Your immune system needs active rest. Limit physical activities.
4. **Soothing Remedies:** Gargle with warm salt water for a sore throat, or use steam inhalation for congestion.

🌐 *Type in your preferred Indian language — IndicNER understands Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, Punjabi, Marathi, Assamese, Kannada, Malayalam, and Odia.*

*Important Note:* If your temperature goes above 102°F (38.9°C), persists for more than 3 days, or is accompanied by difficulty breathing, please consult a healthcare professional. You can easily schedule an appointment with a General Physician on Aarogya AI's Booking panel!`,
